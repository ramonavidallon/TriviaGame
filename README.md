In this repository I have created Trivia Game for the user to complete.

//RULES OF THE GAME (PLAY BY PLAY)//
1. ONCE THE WINDOW LOADS THERE WILL BE A BUTTON ("LET'S BEGIN") THAT THE USER WILL USE TO BEGIN THE GAME.
2. USER HAS 3MIN (180 SEC) TO COMPLETE ALL 6 QUESTIONS PROVIDED
3. THE QUESTIONS WILL REVOLVE AROUND SEATTLE SPORTS QUESTIONS THAT WILL INCLUDE BASEBALL, FOOTBALL, AND BASKETBALL
4. IF THE USER FAILS TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS BY THE TIME 3 MINUTES IS UP, IT WOULD BE AN AUTOMATIC FAIL, BUT I WILL SHOW THE USER WHICH QUESTIONS THEY MANAGED TO GET CORRECT.
5. IF THEY USER SUCCESSFULLY ANSWERS ALL THE QUESTIONS REGARDLESS IF IT IS WRONG OR NOT, THE USER WILL BE DIRECTED TO A NEW WINDOW WHERE IT WILL DISPLAY THE AMOUNT OF RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS THE USER HAD.
6. A "TRY AGAIN" <BUTTON> WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO GIVE THE OPTION TO THE USER IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO RETAKE THE QUIZ.
  
With the tools of HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, BootStrap, and Google Fonts; I was able to come up with a "Seattle Sports Themed" trivia game.

ENJOYED: THE CSS AND STYLING OF THE WEBPAGE AS A WHOLE

CHALLENGES: GETTING MY JAVASCRIPT TO EXECUTE CLEANLY AND FIRING ON ALL FUNCTIONS

I AM THE SOLE CONTRIBUTER TO THIS PROJECT.
